# SRAM editor for SMW

[![Build](https://github.com/elusivesmw/sram-smw/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elusivesmw/sram-smw/actions/workflows/build.yml)

WIP: This will be a save file (`.srm`) editor for Super Mario World romhacks, to be used in conjunction with Lunar Magic. Set levels and events as passed, give midways, change Mario's position on the overworld, etc. Useful when playing romhacks that don't have many saves.
